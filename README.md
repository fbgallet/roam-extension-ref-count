# Page references counter

### Counter for page references (including tags and attributes) as superscript. Click on the couter to open linked references in the sidebar.
### 🔎 Reference counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box, which is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!
### 🆕 New in v.4: see at a glane, through the page reference, if the page is empty or not.

If you find that counters are sometimes annoying, here are some options (with a command in the Command Palette and customizable hotkeys for the first two):
- toggle on/off inline count or search count (separately),
- make the counter appear only on hover over a given page reference,
- reduce the opacity (more or less grey),
- reduce the size.

With opacity to 0.25 and size to small, the counters will be very subtle.
