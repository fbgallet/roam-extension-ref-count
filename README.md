# Page references counter

### Inline page references count (tag and attribute too) as superscript ! Counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, directly in the autocomplete box.

By default, inline count is displayed only on hover, but can be set to be always displayed.

Counts in search are particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings.

You can toggle separately inline count and search count with dedicated commands in command palette.
