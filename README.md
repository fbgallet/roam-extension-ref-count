# Page references counter

### Inline count for page references, tags and attributes as superscript (like vanilla inline block reference counter). 
ðŸ”Ž References counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box, what is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!

By default, inline counts are always displayed. As an option, you can make the count appear only on hover over a given page reference.
You can toggle separately inline count and search count with dedicated commands in command palette (with customizable hotkeys).
