# Page references counter

**Counter for page references (including tags and attributes) as superscript, customizable and clickable.**

ðŸ”Ž Reference counts are also displayed **when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box**, which is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!\*\*

If you find that counters are sometimes annoying, you can enable them only for page reference or tags or attributes, independently (ðŸ†• New in v.5), see options above. Here are some other possibilities (with a command in the Command Palette and customizable hotkeys for the first two):

- toggle on/off inline count or search count (separately),
- make the counter appear only on hover over a given page reference,
- reduce the opacity (more or less grey),
- reduce the size.

With opacity to 0.25 and size to small, the counters will be very subtle.

### ðŸ†• New in v.4: Click on the counter to open linked references in the sidebar

### ðŸ†• New in v.4: See if a page is empty or not

If a page is empty, its reference is underlined with a dotted line when hovering over it (for tags: only when hovering over the counter), and its title is greyed in seach and auto-complete boxes.

If a page is not empty, its inline reference has a light grey background (only page refs, not tags) and is underlined with a solid line when hovering over it (for tags: when hovering over the counter).

This formatting appears in Roam page only if inline counters are enabled (they always appear in search/autocomplete boxes).
