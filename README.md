# Page references counter

### Counter for page references (including tags and attributes) as superscript. 
### ðŸ”Ž References counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box, what is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!

If you find that counters are sometimes annoying, here are some options (with a command in Command palette and customizable hokkeys for the first two):
- toggle on/off inline count or search count (separately),
- make the counter appear only on hover over a given page reference,
- reduce the opacity (more or less grey),
- reduce the size.

With opacity to 0.25 and size to small, the counters will be very subtle.
